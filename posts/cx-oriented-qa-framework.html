                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>In the modern software development landscape, ensuring customer happiness is crucial, which calls for a paradigm shift in Quality Assurance approaches toward customer experience-centric methodologies. Traditional QA procedures frequently concentrate on identifying and fixing functional flaws while overlooking the critical component of how the software impacts the end-user's overall experience.</p>
                            
                            <p>The success of any new product depends on how well it meets user needs; failure to do so can lead to poor customer experiences, declining brand value, and financial losses from defect discovery and resolution. Therefore, a comprehensive QA framework should include systems for gathering, evaluating, and acting upon customer feedback to bridge the gap between technical software quality and perceived customer value.</p>

                            <div class="highlight-box">
                                <h4>üéØ Framework Objectives</h4>

                                    <li>Create closed-loop feedback systems for continuous improvement</li>
                                    <li>Proactively detect and resolve CX issues before customer impact</li>
                                    <li>Align technical quality with customer expectations and satisfaction</li>
                                    <li>Enable data-driven testing strategies based on real user feedback</li>

                            <p>This study presents a novel QA framework that combines post-release defect patterns, test coverage analysis, and Customer Experience indicators like Net Promoter Score and churn rate. The main goal is to create a closed-loop system where testing strategies are directly influenced by customer feedback, resulting in more reliable and user-focused software releases.</p>

                            <h2>Background and Related Work</h2>
                            <p>Extensive research on CRM system integration and its effects on customer satisfaction has identified a gap in evaluating quality aspects that align these systems with an organization's CRM strategy. Prior research highlights that creating successful CRM systems requires a thorough understanding of the customer experience, enabling businesses to identify weaknesses and make necessary improvements to better serve diverse stakeholders.</p>

                            <h3>Customer Experience Management</h3>
                            <p>Customer Experience Management is proposed as a more relevant approach because traditional customer satisfaction analysis methods frequently fail to effectively incorporate information about consumer expectations. The customer experience represents the internal and subjective reaction of customers to every direct or indirect interaction with a business, while Quality of Experience refers to the subjective, comprehensive, intrinsic, general, symbolic, and emotional evaluation or reaction of a consumer.</p>

                            <p>A crucial triangle that drives competitiveness is formed by the interaction of quality, customer relationship management, and customer loyalty. Understanding this relationship is essential for businesses seeking to maintain competitive advantage and achieve sustainable growth.</p>

                            <h3>Research Context</h3>
                            <p>The framework builds upon existing research in quality management, customer experience measurement, and software testing methodologies. It addresses the limitations of traditional QA approaches by incorporating customer-centric metrics and feedback mechanisms that directly influence testing strategies and software quality improvements.</p>

                            <p><strong>B2B Applications:</strong> CX metrics often reflect the experiences of multiple stakeholders within an organization, including end-users, administrators, and decision-makers. The QA framework must accommodate the diverse needs and expectations of these various user groups.</p>

                            <p><strong>B2C Applications:</strong> CX metrics tend to be more directly tied to individual user experiences, making it easier to identify specific pain points and areas for improvement. Metrics like app store ratings, user reviews, and social media sentiment become particularly important.</p>

                        <!-- QA Limitations -->

                            <h2>Quality Assurance and its Limitations</h2>
                            <p>While QA procedures excel at finding functional flaws and ensuring technical requirements are met, they frequently fail to capture the subtleties of the customer experience. Traditional testing approaches typically focus on verifying that software features function as intended, without necessarily assessing how those features enhance the overall user experience.</p>

                            <h3>Gaps in Traditional QA</h3>
                            <p><strong>Technical Focus:</strong> Conventional QA often prioritizes technical quality metrics over user experience considerations, potentially leading to software that is functionally sound but falls short of customer expectations.</p>

                            <p><strong>Limited Customer Feedback Integration:</strong> Traditional QA lacks the tools for integrating customer feedback into the testing cycle, creating a gap between technical quality and perceived customer value.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reactive Approach:</strong> Most QA processes are reactive, addressing issues after they've been identified rather than proactively preventing customer experience problems.</p>

                            <h3>Impact on Business Outcomes</h3>
                            <p>The narrow focus on technical quality measures may lead to the release of software that is functionally sound but falls short of customer expectations, ultimately affecting business outcomes and causing dissatisfaction. To close this gap, a more comprehensive approach that incorporates real-time process performance monitoring and analysis is required.</p>

                            <p>The proposed framework combines several essential elements to produce a closed-loop system that continuously enhances the client experience through focused QA efforts. These elements work together to ensure that user feedback is effectively converted into actionable information that informs testing strategies and ultimately improves software usability and quality.</p>

                            <h3>Architectural Principles</h3>
                            <p><strong>Centralized Control:</strong> Centralizing control of QA operations eliminates repetitive work, improves platform configuration variety, and integrates models to drive the CX-oriented QA process.</p>

                            <p><strong>Stakeholder Perspective Integration:</strong> The framework addresses the various viewpoints of stakeholders engaged in providing a good or service, ensuring comprehensive quality coverage.</p>

                            <p><strong>Continuous Feedback Integration:</strong> The foundation of the system is the creation of an ongoing feedback loop that gathers consumer sentiment from various touchpoints through sentiment analysis, topic detection, and sophisticated analytical methods.</p>

                            <h3>Integrating NPS and Churn Rate</h3>
                            <p>A thorough understanding of customer loyalty and its effect on software quality can be obtained by including Net Promoter Score and churn rate into the QA framework. NPS serves as a leading indication of customer sentiment, while churn rate provides a lagging measure of customer satisfaction.</p>

                            <p>By monitoring changes in NPS and churn rate, QA teams can proactively detect and resolve issues before they worsen and have a detrimental effect on customer loyalty. This proactive approach enables organizations to focus testing efforts on areas that customers care about most, resulting in more successful and efficient testing procedures.</p>

                            <p>Traditional test coverage metrics, including branch and statement coverage, aim to ensure that every line of code and execution path is fully tested. However, these measurements often fall short of capturing the subtleties of the customer experience and may not sufficiently address the aspects that are most important to customer satisfaction.</p>

                            <h3>CX-Oriented Coverage Approach</h3>
                            <p><strong>Customer-Centric Prioritization:</strong> CX-oriented test coverage strategies should prioritize testing scenarios that directly affect the customer experience, such as critical user flows, commonly used features, and locations where customers have previously reported problems.</p>

                            <p><strong>Comprehensive Testing Methods:</strong> These strategies should include usability testing, accessibility testing, and performance testing to ensure the software is not just functional but also user-friendly, accessible to all users, and capable of operating well in various scenarios.</p>

                            <p><strong>Real-World Behavior Modeling:</strong> CX-oriented test coverage should include methods for modeling real-world user behavior, which can be accomplished through automated testing tools that simulate user interactions and produce realistic user loads.</p>

                            <h3>Coverage Metrics Integration</h3>
                            <p>The framework integrates traditional code coverage metrics with customer experience indicators to create a more comprehensive understanding of testing effectiveness. This integration helps identify gaps between technical coverage and customer impact, enabling more targeted testing efforts.</p>
