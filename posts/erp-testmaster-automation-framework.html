                        <section id="framework-architecture">
                            <h2>Framework Architecture</h2>
                            <p>The ERP TestMaster framework follows a modular, scalable architecture designed to handle the complexity of enterprise testing while maintaining maintainability and extensibility.</p>

                            <h3>Core Architectural Principles</h3>
                            <p><strong>Modularity:</strong> The framework is built around the concept of modular components that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. Each ERP module has its own test suite with dedicated page objects and utilities.</p>

                            <p><strong>Scalability:</strong> The architecture supports horizontal scaling, allowing tests to run in parallel across multiple environments and browsers. This design enables efficient resource utilization and faster test execution.</p>

                            <p><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Clear separation of concerns, consistent naming conventions, and comprehensive documentation ensure the framework can be easily maintained and extended by different team members.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reusability:</strong> Common functionality is abstracted into reusable components, reducing code duplication and improving consistency across test scenarios.</p>

                            <h3>Component Structure</h3>
                            <p>The framework is organized into several key components:</p>

                            <p><strong>Page Object Models:</strong> Each ERP module has dedicated page objects that encapsulate the user interface elements and interactions. This approach provides a clean abstraction layer between tests and the application under test.</p>

                            <p><strong>Test Data Management:</strong> A centralized data management system handles test data creation, cleanup, and state management. This ensures tests have consistent, reliable data while maintaining data integrity.</p>

                            <p><strong>Utility Functions:</strong> Common operations like authentication, navigation, and data validation are implemented as utility functions that can be reused across different test scenarios.</p>

                            <p><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Environment-specific configurations are managed through configuration files, enabling the framework to run against different environments (development, staging, production) seamlessly.</p>
